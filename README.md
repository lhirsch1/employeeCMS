# Employee CMS Application



## Description

A command line application for managing human assets within a company.

Users are able to view, add, and update employees information, roles, and departments. 

Employees can be sorted by their role, their department, and their manager. 

Users are able to calculate the operating budget of each of the departments. 

## Future Developments

The next scheduled update is to add delete functionality. Currently, users are not able to remove assets from the company structure. 

More functionality will be given to the ORM instead of living in the app.js file.
